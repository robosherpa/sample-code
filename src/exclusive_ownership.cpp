/*
Exclusive ownership policy
This policy states that whenever a resource management object is copied, the resource handle is transferred from the source pointer to the destination pointer. In the process, the source pointer is set to nullptr to make ownership exclusive. At any time, the resource handle belongs only to a single object, which is responsible for its deletion when it is no longer needed.

The code example on the right illustrates the basic idea of exclusive ownership.
