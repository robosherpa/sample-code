Lvalues have an address that can be accessed. They are expressions whose evaluation by the compiler determines the identity of objects or functions.

Prvalues do not have an address that is accessible directly. They are temporary expressions used to initialize objects or compute the value of the operand of an operator.

For the sake of simplicity and for compliance with many tutorials, videos and books about the topic, let us refer to prvalues as rvalues from here on.
